# Release Notes - v1.1.0

## 🎉 Major Update: Zoom Plugin Integration

This release adds comprehensive support for the Zoom plugin, bringing a **Roam Research-style** focused editing experience to Obsidian!

---

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **Zoom Plugin Breadcrumb Cleanup**
- ✅ Hides `[[` and `]]` brackets in Zoom breadcrumbs
- ✅ Removes duplicate inline titles when zooming
- ✅ Hides the last breadcrumb item (already shown in content)
- ✅ Hides task checkboxes `[ ]` and `[x]` in breadcrumbs

### 2. **Roam-Style Indent Reset** ⭐
**The killer feature of this release!**

When you zoom into any bullet point, the indentation automatically resets:
- 📍 The focused bullet **always starts from the first level**
- 📍 Child bullets indent normally from the second level onward
- 📍 Works perfectly at **any nesting depth** (tested up to 10 levels)
- 📍 **Dynamic detection**: Automatically adjusts when switching focus

**Technical Implementation:**
- JavaScript dynamically detects the first visible list item's level
- Applies CSS rules to hide the corresponding number of indent markers
- MutationObserver ensures real-time updates on focus changes

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files Changed
- **main.js**:
  - Added `detectZoomLevel()` function for dynamic level detection
  - Added regex to remove `[ ]` and `[x]` from breadcrumbs
  - Integrated level detection with MutationObserver

- **styles.css**:
  - Added Zoom header cleanup rules
  - Added 10 levels of indent reset rules (`.zoom-level-2` through `.zoom-level-10`)
  - Uses CSS `nth-child` selectors for precise indent hiding

### Performance
- ✅ Minimal overhead (only 50-100ms delay for DOM updates)
- ✅ Efficient selector targeting (no unnecessary DOM scans)
- ✅ Console logging for debugging (`✓ Zoom 聚焦层级: X`)
